#' Parameters to select a reasonable value of 'a'

#' Returns a list of parameters that other functions accept for the 'a' parameter

#' @param meth The name of the method to use

#' @param nnn The number of nearest neighbors

    ## Returns a data frame with the settings that define how a value for 'a' should be automatically selected. Columns include
    ##    a.meth  The name of the method for finding a (default is "nn" method for 'nearest neighbor' method.
    ##            Someday I may also use a value of a as a function of c.e.
    ##      a.pp  the proportion of parent points that should have at least a.nn neighbors (default 0.98)
    ##      a.nn  the number of nearest neighbors (default 2, so each point is in a triangle)
    ##       a.h   A hull extensivity coefficient, which will be multiplied times the value of a which satisfies p% of points having n nearest neighbors
    ##     a.tct  a time threshhold (expressed as a percentage of the median sampling frequency), such that
    ##            if a point is temporally disconnected from its a.nn / 2 nearest temporal neighbors by more than
    ##            than a.tct times the median sampling frequency, the point will be be excluded from the computation of a
    ##            This is to avoid bias from internal time gaps (default 1.05)
