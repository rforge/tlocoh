\arguments{
  \item{lxy}{A LoCoH-xy object}

  \item{dt}{Include a histogram of the number of locations
  over time) (T/F)}

  \item{d}{Include a histogram of distance travelled per
  adjacent points (i.e., step length) (T/F)}

  \item{delta.t}{Include a histogram of the time between
  points (i.e., sampling frequency) (T/F)}

  \item{v}{Include a histogram of point velocity (distance
  over delta.t) (T/F)}

  \item{dt.bins.base}{Where to start the first bin ((for
  histogram of number of points over time): "secs", "mins",
  "hours", "days"}

  \item{dt.bins.width}{The width of the time bins (for
  histogram of number of points over time). In seconds.}

  \item{figs.per.page}{Number of plots per page}

  \item{col}{The color of the bars}

  \item{d.tct}{temporal connectivity thsesshold for the
  distance between two points to be included in the
  histogram of step length. In other words, detlta.t must
  be <= median delta.t * d.tct). Ignored if d=F.}

  \item{delta.t.num.sd}{Number of standard deviations for
  delta.t to be included in the histogram. To omit outliers
  from appearing in the histogram (which can make the
  central data more difficult to discern, set
  delta.t.num.sd to ~2. Ignored if delta.t=F.}

  \item{time.unit}{The unit of time on the x-axis
  (character). Ignored if delta.t=F.}

  \item{overlay.median}{Plot the median value on the
  histogram (T/F)}
}
\value{
  A list of frequencies with one element for each of the
  histograms plotted.
}
\description{
  Displays histogram(s) of point-to-point step length,
  velocity, and sampling frequency for a LoCoH-xy object
