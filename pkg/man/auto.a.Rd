\title{Parameters to select a reasonable value of 'a'}
\usage{
auto.a(meth = "nn", ptp = 0.98, nnn = 2, tct = 1.05)
}
\arguments{
  \item{meth}{The name of the method for finding a (default
  is "nn" method for 'nearest neighbor' method.}

  \item{ptp}{The proportion of total points [0..1]}

  \item{nnn}{The number of nearest neighbors}

  \item{tct}{The temporal continuity threshhold, see
  details.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns \code{meth}, \code{ptp},
\code{nnn}, and \code{tct} which are the settings that
other functions will use to find a value for 'a' should be
automatically selected. Columns include:

\itemize{ \item \emph{meth} The name of the method for
finding a \item \emph{ptp} The proportion of parent points
that should have at least a.nn neighbors (default 0.98)
\item \emph{nnn} The minimum number of nearest neighbors
that each point will get (default 2, so each point can be
part of a triangle) \item \emph{tct} A time threshhold
(expressed as a percentage of the median sampling
frequency), such that if a point is temporally disconnected
from its 2 nearest temporal neighbors by more than than
\code{tct} times the median sampling frequency, the point
will be be excluded from the computation of a. This is to
avoid bias from internal time gaps (default 1.05) }
}
\description{
Returns a list of parameters that other functions accept
for the 'a' parameter
}
\details{
If multiple values are passed for any of the parameters,
the resulting data frame will have multiple rows and other
parameters will be recycled as needed.

This function does not actually find nearest neighgors.
Rather it returns a list of parameters that can be used as
input in other functions such as \code{\link{lxy.nn.add}}.
