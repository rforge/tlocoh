\description{
Plots a histogram of the revisit times a LoCoH-hullset area
}
\details{
This function will plot a histogram of the revisitation times for a hullset. Revisitation time is simply the time between points enclosed in a hull. Basically, all points enclosed by each hull are examined and their time intervals computed. This may help reveal where there are natural temporal cycles in revisitation, for example if you see a spike in revisitation around 24 hours there may be daily revisitation pattern in some of the hulls. You can specify the minimum amount of time-away to show in the histogram (e.g., if enclosed points that are separated by the median sampling interval are of little interest), as well as the maximum time-away period. Note that revisition metrics do *not* have to be computed for the hullset for the histogram to be computed.
