\description{
Finds the value of a such that p percent of points are a
nearest neighbor for at least one hull
}
\details{
This function finds the value of 'a' (within a specified
threshhold \code{prec}) such that the proportion \code{ptp}
of all points will be a nearest neighbor for at least one
hull. This value of 'a' is intended to be a reasonable
lower bound for a home range that includes as many points
as desired, but minimizes areas where the individual was
not observed. This assumes that duplicate points will be
offset by a random amount when creating hullset(s).

If no value of \code{prec} is passed, it will default to
one-half of the median step legnth of the entire dataset if
timestamps are present. If timestamps are not present, it
will use the median non-zero nearest neighbor distance for
the entire dataset.

Note that the value of 'a' such that \code{ptp} of points
are nearest neighbors does not mean that \code{ptp} points
are enclosed. Points can be enclosed by hulls that are not
a nearest neighbor of any hull parent point.
