\value{
If \code{png.fn} or \code{png.dir} is passed, the plots are
exported to PNG file(s) and the function returns a list of
file names and image dimensions (in pixels). Otherwise
returns a named list whose element(s) are of class
\emph{locoh.hsp}. This list of \emph{locoh.hsp} objects can
then be 'permanently' saved in the LoCoH-hullset object
using \code{\link{lhs.hsp.add}}, and/or fed into other
functions such as \code{\link{plot.locoh.lhs}} (to
symbolize hull points).
}
\description{
Multi-purpose scatterplot function for the hull metrics in
a LoCoH-hullset
}
\details{
This function has two main purposes. 1) To make scatterplot
graphics either in a plot window or PNG file 2) To create a
list of objects of class "locoh.hsp", which are basically a
collection of the parameters that were used to create the
scatterplot including any manually drawn regions created by
the user (see \code{regions}).

Note that hull metrics must already have been computed.
Several hull metrics are 'automatically' computed when the
hullset is defined (e.g., hull area, number of enclosed
points). Other hull metrics must be created separately with
functions such as \code{\link{lhs.ellipses.add}} and
\code{\link{lhs.visit.add}}. Auxillary parameters required
for hull metrics can be passed either as individual
parameters (e.g., \code{ivg=3600*12}) or as a list element
(e.g., \code{hmap=list(ivg=86400)}).

\code{filter}, if passed, will create scatterplots for
subsets of hulls. For this to work, \code{filter} must be a
list whose elements are named lists with the following
elements: \emph{idx} = a vector of the indices of the hulls
(in the hulls SpatialPolygonsDataFrame), \emph{label} = a
label for the subset, and \emph{col} = a color value.
\code{\link{lhs.filter.hsp}} can be used to create a filter
list based on manually drawn regions of a hull scatterplot,
and \code{\link{lhs.filter.anv}} can be used to create a
filter based on ranges of values of an ancillary variable.
The arguments \code{filter.sampsize.in.subtitle},
\code{filter.col.use}, and \code{filter.axes.uniform}
control how the subsets are treated in the scatterplot(s).
