}
\description{
  Export hulls, hull parent points, and/or isopleths from a
  locoh-hullset object to ESRI's shapefile format
}
\note{
  Filenames for the resulting shapefiles are automatically
  generated, but you can specify the directory with the
  \code{dir} argument and the base of the file name with
  \code{file.base}. The constructed filenames will consist
  of a base followed by the name of the hullset and a
  suffix indicating the type of feature saved (e.g.,
  '.hulls', '.pts', ".iso", etc. ). If a shapefile already
  exists with the same name, a unique filename will be
  constructed by appending a two-digit numeric extension.

  Most of the time, exporting hull parent points
  (\code{hpp=T}) is the same as exporting all points
  (\code{allpts=T}), however in some cases not all points
  have enough neighbors to make a hull so they wouldn't be
  included in exported of hull parent points. Only hull
  parent points will have the corresponding hull metrics
  included in the attribute table.

  \code{avl.file}, if passed, is the name of an ArcView 3.x
  legend file that contains symbology info. If a value is
  passed, the script will make a copy of avl.file with the
  same base name as the shapefile, so that symbology will
  automatically created in ArcMap. \code{avl.file} is
  presumed to be relative to the working folder.
