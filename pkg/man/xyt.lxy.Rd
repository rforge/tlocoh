\arguments{
  \item{xy}{A two-column matrix or data frame containing
  the xy coordinates of the points}

  \item{dt}{Optional vector of date-time values (either
  POSIXct objects or objects that can be coerced to
  POSIXct)}

  \item{id}{Optional character vector or factor containing
  the name(s) of the individual(s) of each location.}

  \item{ptid}{Optional integer vector of point id values}

  \item{proj4string}{Projection string object of class
  \code{\link{CRS-class}}}

  \item{anv}{Optional ancillary variables for each point
  (data frame with same number of records as xy)}

  \item{anv.desc}{Optional character vector with
  descriptions of the ancillary variables (in the same
  order as they appear in \code{anv})}

  \item{tz}{The name of the time zone that will be assigned
  if not explicit in dt.}

  \item{del.dup.xyt}{Whether to delete duplicate rows with
  the same x, y, dt, and id value. (T/F)}

  \item{dup.dt.check}{Whether to check to make sure there
  are no duplicate date values for the same id}

  \item{col}{Optional vector of color values (one for each
  point), or a single color value}

  \item{dt.int.round.to}{The proportion of the median
  sampling frequency that time intervals will be rounded to
  when computing the frequency table of sampling intervals
  (no change is made to the time stamps)}

  \item{tau.diff.max}{The maximum deviation from tau
  (expressed as a proportion of tau) that a point-to-point
  time difference must fall within for the point-to-point
  distance to be included in the calculation of the median
  step length}

  \item{req.id}{Require a value for id (T/F)}

  \item{warn.latlong}{Show a warning message if coordinates
  appear to be in geographic coordinates (T/F)}

  \item{status}{Show status messages (T/F)}
}
\value{
  A object of class \code{\link{locoh.lxy}}
}
\description{
  Creates a \link{LoCoH-xy} object from a set of location
  data
}
\note{
  At a minimum, a locoh-xy object contains a set of points.
  It can also contain date-time values for each point, the
  name of the individual(s) associated with each point, and
  a nearest nieghbors lookup table.

  Providing values for ptid enables linking the hulls and
  hull metrics generated by tlocoh to other variables
  assoicated with each point that are not used by T-locoh
  (e.g., humidity)

  Importing date-time values into R is often a painful
  process. You may want to try exporting your date-time
  values from your spreadsheet or database as a character
  field that is formatted in a style that R will recognize
  as a time. To see a date-time format that R will be able
  to convert to a date- time object (class POSIXct), type
  in R \code{Sys.time()}. Once you've noted the date-time
  format recognized by R, try to format the date field in
  your spreadsheet or database in a similar manner, then
  export the values in a text format (e.g., csv). For
  example in MS Access, you can use the \code{format()}
  function as part of a query to format a date field, e.g.
  \code{format(PointDate, "yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss")}. In
  Excel, you can go to Format - Cells and give the
  date-time cells a custom format \code{yyyy-mm-dd
  hh:mm:ss}.

  The time zone paramter \code{tz} is optional. If
  \code{tz} is omitted, R will try to get the timezone from
  dt, and if there is no timezone specified set it to
  \code{UTC}. Valid timezone names are to some extent OS
  specific, see
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_zoneinfo_time_zones}.
  If dt is of class POSIXct (which stores the time zone)
  and a different value for \code{tz} is passed, a prompt
  will ask whether date values should be converted.

  Other variables, including environmental variables or
  biometric variables can be brought in using the
  \code{anv} parameter. These variables can then be used in
  hull metrics (see also xxx).
