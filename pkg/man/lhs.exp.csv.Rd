\arguments{
  \item{lhs}{A LoCoH-hullset object}

  \item{id}{The name(s) of individuals to export}

  \item{k}{The k value of hullsets to export}

  \item{r}{The r value of hullsets to export}

  \item{a}{The a value of hullsets to export}

  \item{s}{The s value of hullsets to export}

  \item{hs.names}{The name(s) of saved hullsets to analyze}

  \item{csv.save}{Whether to create csv file(s). If FALSE,
  a list of data frames will still be returned. T/F}

  \item{dir}{The directory where the csv file(s) will be
  saved}

  \item{csv.fn.pre}{A prefix for the csv file name(s)}

  \item{csv.fn.mid}{Style of the filename mid-section:
  none, short, or long}

  \item{hm}{The name of hull metric(s) that will be
  exported. Character vector or comma separated string.}

  \item{anv}{The name(s) of ancillary variables(s) of the
  parent point of each hull to be exported. Default is
  NULL, can also be set to 'all'. Character vector or comma
  separated string.}

  \item{hsp}{A list containing one hull scatterplot object
  with regions saved (i.e., object returned by
  \code{\link{lhs.plot.scatter}}), or the index of a hull
  scatter plot saved in the hullset (see
  \code{\link{lhs.hsp.add}}). If passed, a column for the
  region number will be included in the attribute table.
  Applicable only to hulls and hull parent points.}

  \item{status}{Show messages. T/F}
}
\value{
  List (one list element for each hullset) of data frames
  of hull metrics and possibly ancillary variables
}
\description{
  Export hull metrics to a csv file / data frame
}
\note{
  This function exports hull metrics only. If you want to
  export the coordinates of the hulls themselves for
  further analysis in a GIS, see \code{/link{lhs.exp.shp}}.

  If \code{file} is left blank, no csv file will be written
  to disk but the function will still return a list of data
  frames (one for each hullset)

  If you have created a scatterplot legend with manually
  defined regions (see tutorial for details), the region
  number of each hull parent point can be included in the
  csv file if you pass the hullscatter plot as parameter
  \code{hsp}.
