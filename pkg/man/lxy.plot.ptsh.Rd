\description{
Plots the proportion of time-selected hulls over 's'
}
\details{
This function will plot the proportion of total hulls that are 'time-selected'. Time-selected means all of the
nearest neighbors are were sampled sequentially in time. This is one end of the spectrum as far as nearest neighbor
identification goes, the other being space-selected (i.e., time has no bearing). The \code{s} parameter in the TSD equation
determines the degree to which time plays a role in the point-to-point 'distance'. When \code{s=0}, time plays no role
in TSD and TSD is equivalent to Euclidean distance. As \code{s} increases, time plays a bigger and bigger role until
eventually nearest neighbor selection is equivalent to selection points based only on their separation in time.

In order to plot the proportion of time-selected hulls (ptsh), nearest neighbors must have  already been identified. This 
can be done in one of two ways. The \code{\link{lxy.ptsh.add}} function will compute ptsh for different values of s using
a random sample of points (to save time), automatically picking values of s such that ptsh is close to target values provided by the user. Alternately, one can identify nearest neighbors for different values of \code{s}
using \code{\link{lxy.nn.add}} and then run this function with \code{use.nn=TRUE}. The main difference between \code{\link{lxy.ptsh.add}}
and \code{\link{lxy.nn.add}} is that \code{\link{lxy.ptsh.add}} finds nearest neighbors for a random sample of points, and doesn't
actually save the nearest neighbor information for individual points, whereas \code{\link{lxy.nn.add}} identifies and saves
nearest neighbor information for each and every point.
