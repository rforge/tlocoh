\value{
A list of plots created, with one element per id, and each element consisting of another 
list with elements for the filename (or NULL), filename dimensions in pixels (or NULL), the MTD ratios 
(as a list with one element for each value of s), descriptive text, and the k/a/r value
}
\description{
Plot distributions of the ratio of maximum theoretical distance times 's' over TSD for all unique pairs of nearest neighbors
}
\details{
This function plots the ratio of the maximum theoretical distance the individual could have traveled (multiplied by 's') over the 
total TSD distance metric for all nearests neighbors for the specified value of k/a/r for different values of s. 
This ratio will of course never be greater than one because the maximum theoretical distance
is one of the terms in TSD. The purpose of this function is to see the effect of s on the relative contribution 
of the time term in the TSD metric.

This function requires that nearest neighbors already be computed. To identify nearest neighbors for a range of 's' values,
use \code{\link{lxy.ptsh.add}} (see examples).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## Identify a range of 's' values from space-selection to time-selection, 
## and find 10 nearest neighbors for each value of 's'
lxy <- lxy.ptsh(lxy, nn=TRUE)
## Plot the ratio of maximum theoretical distance travel to TSD 
lxy.plot.mtdr(lxy)
