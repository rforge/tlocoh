\arguments{
  \item{lhs}{A LoCoH-hullset object}

  \item{metric}{The name of the hull metric used as a proxy
  for directionality}

  \item{thresh.val}{The threshhold above which a hull is
  considered part of a directional route}

  \item{thresh.type}{The type of thresshold used. If
  \code{'q'} for quantile, then \code{thresh.val} is taken
  to be a percentile of the full range of the
  directionality metric values (i.e., 0 < \code{thresh.val}
  < 1). If \code{'v'}, \code{thresh.val} is taken to be an
  actual value of the threshhold metric.}

  \item{smooth}{The amount of temporal smoothing applied,
  expressed as the number of points on either side
  (temporally) of the parent point whose average of the
  directionality metric is used for determining if the hull
  constructed around the parent point should be considered
  a part of a directional route. For no smoothing, set
  \code{smooth = 0}.}

  \item{status}{Display status messages}

  \item{show.elong.hist}{Whether to display histogram(s) of
  the distribution of the directionality metric before and
  after smoothing. T/F}

\description{
  Defines 'directional routes' by identifying parent points
  that are 1) temporally contiguous and 2) have hulls in
  the top n% of elongation values
}
\note{
  Directional routes are line segments defined by
  connecting temporally contiguous hull parent-points that
  are in the top N percent of hull elongation. Hull
  elongation is proxied by one of two hull metrics:
  perimeter:area ratio ('par') or the eccentricity of the
  bounding ellipse ('ecc'). Hull perimeter:area ratios are
  automatically computed when a hullset is created;
  bounding ellipses must be computed separately using
  \code{\link{lhs.ellipses.add}}. Once computed, you can
  plot directional routes by passing \code{dr=TRUE} to
  \code{\link{plot.locoh.lhs}}.
