\title{Change the id value(s) in a LoCoH-xy object}
\usage{
lxy.id.new(lxy, id.new, save.old.id = NULL, dup.dt = c("check", "offset",
  "ignore")[1], dup.dt.offset = 5, dt.int.round.to = 0.1,
  tau.diff.max = 0.02, status = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{lxy}{A \link{LoCoH-xy} object}

  \item{id.new}{New value(s) for the id (i.e., name of the
  individual(s)). Can be either a single character object
  'broken_tooth', or factor or character vector of the same
  length as the number of points}

  \item{save.old.id}{Whether to save the old ids as an
  ancillary variable. Can be T/F, or the name of a column
  in the ancillary variables data frame, see Details}

  \item{dup.dt}{What to do if duplicate dt values are
  encountered in the merged object, see details}

  \item{dup.dt.offset}{The maximum offset in seconds to
  offset duplicate dt values, used only if \code{dup.dt =
  "offset"}}

  \item{dt.int.round.to}{The proportion of the median
  sampling frequency that time intervals will be rounded to
  when computing the frequency table of sampling intervals
  (no change is made to the time stamps)}

  \item{tau.diff.max}{The maximum deviation from tau (the
  median delta.t of the entire dataset), expressed as a
  proportion of tau, that time difference between two
  points must fall for the distance between those two
  points to be included in the calculation of the median
  step length}

  \item{status}{Show status messages. T/F}
}
\value{
A \link{LoCoH-xy} object containing the original xys, dt,
ptid and ancillary values for each point. Other items and
attributes (including the comment) will be recreated or set
to NULL

\description{
Changes the id values in a LoCoH-xy object, with option to
save the 'old' id values as an ancillary variable
}
\details{
This function can be used to change the id value for each
point. Note that the id value is the name of the individual
animal or device, as opposed to ptid which is a unique
numeric integer for each point.

\code{tau.diff.max} exists to eliminate the inclusion of
temporal outliers in the computation of the median step
length. The time difference betwen points must be withint
\code{tau.diff.max} of tau for that pair of points to be
included in step length calculation.

One can also use this function to change the id (name of
the individual), rebuild the rw.params or table of sampling
frequencies
