\title{Split a character object into multiple lines}
\usage{
strSplitAtChar(object, size, char = ".", separator = paste("\\n", char, sep
  = ""), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Input character vector (should be length 1)}

\item{size}{The maximum number of characters in one piece}

\item{char}{The character to split the input string at}

\item{separator}{The character to use as a separator in the returned object}

\item{...}{Other arguments (unused)}
}
\description{
Split a character object at a specific character to wrap to multiple lines for plotting
}
\details{
This will take a long character object and split it into pieces at character \code{char} such that the length of each piece is <= \code{size}.
If \code{separator} is passed, the individual pieces will be concatenated using the \code{separator} character and returned as a character vector of length 1.
Otherwise each piece will be returned as a separate element of a character vector.
