\usage{
  mvee(xy = NULL, tolerance = 0.005, plotme = FALSE,
    max.iter = 500, shiftxy = TRUE, no.ellipse.val = 1,
    checks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{xy}{a two-column data frame containing x and y
  coordinates. If NULL then a random sample set of 10
  points will be generated}

  \item{tolerance}{a tolerance value}

  \item{plotme}{Plot the points and ellipse (T/F)}

  \item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations before
  giving up. If the script tries this number of iterations
  but still can't get to the tolerance value, it displays
  an error message and returns NULL}

  \item{shiftxy}{Apply a shift to the coordinates to make
  them smaller and speed up the matrix calculations, then
  reverse the shift to the center point of the resulting
  ellipoid (T/F)}

  \item{no.ellipse.val}{Determines what the function
  returns if a mvee can not be found (e.g., if the points
  are colinear). The default value 1 means a NULL will be
  returned. A value of 2 means a list of NAs will be
  returned which is more useful if these values will be
  stored in a data frame.}

  \item{checks}{Check \code{xy} object for the correct data
  type and remove any duplicate points. T/F}
}
\value{
  A list containing the "center form" matrix equation of
  the ellipse. i.e. a 2x2 matrix "A" and a 2x1 vector "C"
  representing the center of the ellipse such that: (x -
  C)' A (x - C) <= 1 List elements include A - 2x2 matrix C
  - 2x1 vector of the center coordinates elps.axes.lngth -
  2x1 vector whose elements are one-half the lengths of the
  major and minor axes (i.e., variables a and b in the
  standard ellipse equation) alpha - angle of rotation
}
\description{
  Computes the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid around a
  set of points using the Khachiyan Algorithm. In two
  dimensions, this is equivalent to the bounding ellipse
