\description{
Thin out closely-timed bursts of locations
}
\note{
Many GPS devices have a feature to save 'bursts' of points
close together in time (relative to the dominant sampling
frequency) The 'burst' feature should not be confused with
point averaging, whereby a GPS device internally averages
locations for a period of time (e.g., 2 minutes) but saves
a single location.

This function can be used to thin out 'bursts' of
locations, when they are an artifact of data collection and
therefore not desirable. Each group of points in a burst is
replaced with a single point.

\code{thresh} is a numeric value for identifying which
points should be considered part of a burst. When
\code{thresh} < 1, it is taken to be a proportion of the
median sampling frequency (0..1), and any pair of points
that are recorded closer in time are considered part of a
'burst', When \code{thresh} > 1, it is taken to be absolute
unit of time (in seconds).

To identify whether there are bursts in a \link{LoCoH-xy}
dataset, and the sampling frequency of those bursts (i.e.,
the value

The two replacement methods are /code{replace="mean"}, in
which case a burst of locations is replaced by a single
point consisting of the spatial and temporal average of the
burst, or /code{replace="median"} in which case a burst of
locations is replaced by the location at the temporal
median of the burst. If /code{replace="mean"}, then any
ancillary variables for the 'new' points will be set to
\code{NA}.

Because this function deletes points, the nearest neighbor
lookup table of the \link{LoCoH-xy} object (if any) will be
deleted, and the parameters for random walk model will be
recomputed.
