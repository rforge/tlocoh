\usage{
lhs.filter.hsp(lhs, id = NULL, k = NULL, r = NULL, a = NULL, s = NULL,
  hs.names = NULL, hsp = NULL, reg.idx = NULL, label = NULL,
  col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{lhs}{A LoCoH-hullset object}

  \item{id}{The name(s) of the individual(s) to include in
  the plot. Character vector or comma-delimited character.}

  \item{k}{The k value of hullsets to create isopleths for}

  \item{r}{The r value of hullsets to create isopleths for}

  \item{a}{The a value of hullsets to create isopleths for}

  \item{s}{The s value of hullsets to create isopleths for}

  \item{hs.names}{The name(s) of saved hullsets to create
  isopleths for}

  \item{hsp}{Either the index of a hull scatterplot(s)
  saved in lhs (use \code{\link{summary.locoh.lhs}} to
  which how many hsp objects have been saved), or a list of
  objects of class \code{locoh.hsp} (i.e., the return value
  of \code{\link{lhs.plot.scatter}}.}

  \item{reg.idx}{A numeric vector of the indices of the
  regions in \code{hsp} to include in the filter}

  \item{label}{Character vector of the labels to use for
  each subset. If not passed, the saved label values in
  \code{hsp} will be used}

  \item{col}{Vector of color values (one per region). If
  omitted the colors saved in \code{hsp} will be used}
}
\value{
A list that defines subsets of hulls, with one element for
each region in \code{hsp}. Each element is a list with
three elements: \describe{ \item{idx}{indices of the hull
parent points} \item{label}{the label of the region of hsp}
\item{col}{the color of the region in hsp} }
}
\description{
Define subsets of hulls based on the location of the parent
point in hull scatterplot space
}
\details{
This will return a list that defines subsets of hulls
grouped according to which manually-digitized region in
scatterplot space the hull parent point falls. This can be
passed to several functions, including
\code{\link{plot.locoh.lhs}} (future), and
\code{\link{lhs.plot.scatter}}, to create plots of subsets
of hulls.

The scatterplot space, including the manually defined
regions, are saved in a \code{locoh.hsp} object. Typically
\code{hsp} will be created using the
\code{\link{lhs.plot.scatter}} function. \code{hsp} objects
can also be saved in the \code{lhs} object (see
\code{\link{lhs.hsp.add}}.

Note that this function can only return subsets for *one*
hullset and *one* hsp object. This means that either
\code{lhs} must contain a single hullset, or other
parameters (e.g., \code{id}, \code{hs.names}, \code{k},
\code{r}, and/or \code{a}) are passed to select one and
only one of the hullsets in \code{lhs}.
