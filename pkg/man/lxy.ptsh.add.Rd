\arguments{
\item{lxy}{A \link{LoCoH-xy} object}

\item{id}{The name(s) of individuals to analyze}

\item{k}{Value for the k-method that will be used to create hulls for the sample points (and then used to find the proportion of time-selected hulls)}

\item{n}{Number of randomly selected points to use as samples (ignored if \code{samp.idx} is passed)}

\item{samp.idx}{A vector of indices of the points to use as samples}

\item{sinit}{The initial value of \emph{s} that will be used to start the iteration to find that value of \emph{s} that produces a proportion of time selected hulls >= ptsh.max}

\item{ptsh.target}{A vector of values 0..1 that will serve as the target \emph{ptsh} values. For each ptsh target, script will 
try to find a value of \emph{s} that generates the targeted proportion of time selected hulls (within \code{ptsh.buf})}

\item{ptsh.max}{The highest value of ptsh for which a value of \emph{s} will be computed. It is generally recommended that this be less than 1.}

\item{ptsh.buf}{The level of accuracy or precison to which the found values of 's' return the targetted ptsh.}

\item{max.iter}{The maximum number of times the script will double sinit in an effort to find the value of s that produces ptsh.max}

\item{max.loops}{The maximum number of intermediate values of s the script will try when 'zooming' in on the target ptsh levels}

\item{max.reached}{What to do if the maximum number of iterations is reached, \code{warning} or \code{stop}}

\item{time.term}{The space-time transformation to use in the TSD distance metric: \code{'vmax'} for the maximum velocity 
transformation (default) or \code{'dif'} for the diffusion transformation.}

\item{FNN.algorithm}{The algorithm to be used in the get.knnx() function in the package FNN}

\item{use.nn}{Whether to use saved nearest neighbor sets for the ptsh computations. T/F}

\item{nn.add}{Whether to also identify and save nearest neighbor sets for all points for \emph{k}=\code{k} and the values of \emph{s} identified. T/F}

\item{use.pb.n}{The sample size (i.e., \code{n}) above which a progress bar will be displayed}

\item{ptsh.exists}{What to do if there is already a ptsh table in the LoCoH-xy object: \code{'replace'} or \code{'append'}}

\item{beep}{Whether to beep when done. T/F}

\item{status}{Display status messages. T/F}

\description{
Identify the values of s that result in proportion p of hulls being time-selected
}
\details{
When \emph{s}=0, nearest neighbors are space-selected (i.e., point-to-point distance is merely 
Euclidean distance). For large values of \emph{s}, nearest neighbors are effectively time-selected (e.g., 
temporally contiguous). One approach to selecting a value of \emph{s} between these two ends of 
the spectrum is to pick a \emph{s} value that returns an intermediate proportion of 
time-selected-hulls representing the desired balance between space and time selection 
(which in turn is shaped by the research question / objective). This function will find the 
value(s) of \emph{s} that produce a desired proportion of time-selected-hulls using a randomly-selected
subset of points. A general rule of thumb is to pick a value of \emph{s} that results in a proportion of time-selected hulls
from 0.4 to 0.6.

The script iteratively tries a variety of \emph{s} values until it finds one that produces the desired 
proportion of time-selected hulls within a tolerance of \code{ptsh.buf}. If for example the vector of target 
values \code{ptsh.target} includes 0.5, and \code{ptsh.buf = 0.01}, the script will try to find a 
value of \emph{s} that results in a proportion of time-selected hulls between 0.49 and 0.51.
