\title{Returns a R expression that will recreate a saved scatterplot of hull metrics}
\usage{
hsp2expr(hsp, reg_nodes_prec = 3, var_name = "hsp")
}
\arguments{
  \item{hsp}{A list of objects of class locoh.hsp}

  \item{reg_nodes_prec}{The number of decimal places that
  will be preserved when printing the coordinates of the
  nodes of manually defined polygon regions in scatterplot
  space}

  \item{var_name}{The name(s) of the variable that will be
  initialized in the output code}
}
\value{
A chunk of R code that will reproduce the \code{hsp} object
}
\description{
Returns a R expression that will recreate a saved
scatterplot of hull metrics
}
\details{
Hull metric scatterplot settings can be saved as an object
for reuse as a map legend or subsetting data (see
\emph{T-LoCoH Tips} on website). Saved scatterplot settings
can include the boundaries of manually defined (i.e., with
the mouse) regions of interest, that can be used as a map
legend or for data subsetting. The purpose of this function
is to generate R code so that polygons that were manually
defined with the mouse in a hull metric scatterplot can be
recreated (e.g., in a markdown document) for the purposes
of reproducible research. \code{hsp2expr} will return a
valid chunk of R code that recreates the saved scatterplot
settings. This code can be copy-pasted into a RMarkdown
document or other report format so the work may be
recreated.
