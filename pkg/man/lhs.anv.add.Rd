\title{Adds an ancillary value to a hullset}
\usage{
lhs.anv.add(lhs, id = NULL, k = NULL, r = NULL, a = NULL,
  s = NULL, hs.names = NULL, anv, anv.desc = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lhs}{A LoCoH-hullset object}

\item{id}{The name(s) of individuals to export}

\item{k}{The k value of hullsets to add an ancillary value to}

\item{r}{The r value of hullsets to add an ancillary value to}

\item{a}{The a value of hullsets to add an ancillary value to}

\item{s}{The s value of hullsets to add an ancillary value to}

\item{hs.names}{The name(s) of saved hullsets to export}

\item{anv}{A vector, named list, or data frame with the same number of values as points}

\item{anv.desc}{A character vector of descriptions}

\item{overwrite}{Whether to overwrite existing ancillary values with the same names (T/F)}
}
\value{
A \link{LoCoH-hullset} object
}
\description{
Add ancillary values to the points of a hullset, which can then be used as hull metrics
}
\details{
This will add one or more ancillary values (columns) to the point locations
in a \link{LoCoH-hullset} object. The name of the columns will be the name of the object passed
(in the case where \code{anv} is a vector), the list element names (in the case of a named list), or 
column names (in the case of a data frame).

In other functions, you can sort (or filter) hulls based on ancillary values of the parent points using the hull metric 'anv' and passing another 
argument (called anv) set to the name of the ancillary value.
