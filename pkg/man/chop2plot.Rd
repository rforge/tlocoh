\arguments{
  \item{str}{The string to format}

  \item{width}{The maximum width of any single line in
  inches}

  \item{char.break}{The character where the string should
  be broken}

  \item{char.break.keep}{Whether to keep the char.break
  character when the string gets broken. T/F}

  \item{cex}{The character expansion factor that will be
  used to display the text}
}
\value{
A two-item character vector containing [1] the formatted
character string with \\n inserted and [2] number of lines
}
\description{
Breaks a long character object into separate lines at
specific characters
}
\note{
This function is designed to break up a potentially long
character object that is going to be added to a plot either
as a title or text. Line breaks will be inserted so that
the string will wrap appropriately at \code{width} inches
when plotted with \code{cex} character expansion factor.

The character object will be broken at the
\code{char.break} characters such that each line will be <=
\code{width} when plotted. Breaks are replaced with
carriage returns. If \code{char.break.keep} is \code{TRUE},
the break character will be kept, otherwise it will be
removed. If no occurrence of the /code{char.break} is
available, the line will be chopped at the last character
that fits.
