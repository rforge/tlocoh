\usage{
  lhs.visit.add(lhs, ivg = NULL, status = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{lhs}{A LoCoH-hullset object}

  \item{ivg}{Value(s) for inter-visit gap (in seconds)
  (numeric vector)}

  \item{status}{Show status messages. T/F.}
}
\value{
  A LoCoH-hullset object
}
\description{
  Computes visitation and duration hull metrics based on
  inter-visit gap value(s)
}
\note{
  The inter-visit gap is the period of time (in seconds)
  which must pass before another occurrence in the hull can
  be considered a separate visit. Occurences in the hull
  are considered a separate visit only if the animal was
  absent from the hull for a period of time >= ivg.

  For each ivg value, the function examines each hull and
  computes the number of separate visits to the hull
  (visitation, hull metric name = "nsv") and the mean
  number of locations per visit (visit duration, hull
  metric name = "mnlv")
