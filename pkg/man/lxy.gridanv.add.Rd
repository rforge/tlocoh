\description{
Add ancillary variable(s) to a LoCoH-xy object from a raster
}
\note{
This function will create new ancillary variables and fill it with the value of the pixel at each point.
The image should be in the same coordinate system as the points. Current the script does not check this.
Any points that fall beyond the edges of the image will be given 'NA' values. If an ancillary variable with the
same name already exists, it will be overwritten.

The image / raster specified by \code{fn} be in a format supported by the \code{readGDAL} function in the rdgal package. Multi-band
formats are support. If the image has multiple bands, you can specify which band(s) to read using the \code{band} parameter.
A separate ancillary variable will be created for each band. You can provide name(s) for the ancillary variable(s) with the
\code{anv.name parameter}.

You can also pass a time-series of images, and the function will use the image that is the closest match in time for each location.
To do this, pass a two column data frame to the parameter \code{dtfn}. The first column of \code{dtfn} must be a date
(one of the POSIXt date-time classes), and the second column must be a valid raster filename. If each image is a time composite,
(e.g., two-week NDVI), the date should either be the mid-point or the beginning date. Two options for time matching are
available: \code{closest} = select the image whose date is closest in time, and \code{before} = pick the closest image
that comes before the location.
