\arguments{
  \item{lhs}{A LoCoH-hullset object}

  \item{save.ellipses}{Save ellipses in the lhs object?
  (T/F). If False, only the eccentricity values of the
  ellipses are saved as a hull metric.}

  \item{existing.ellipses}{Whether to overwrite or abort if
  existing ellipses are saved}

  \item{id}{The name(s) of individuals to analyze}

  \item{k}{The k value of hullsets to analyze}

  \item{r}{The r value of hullsets to analyze}

  \item{a}{The a value of hullsets to analyze}

  \item{s}{The s value of hullsets to analyze}

  \item{hs.names}{The name(s) of saved hullsets to analyze}

  \item{status}{Show status messages (T/F)}

  \item{beep}{Beep when done (T/F)}
}
\value{
  A LoCoH-hullset object
}
\description{
  Creates bounding ellipses around each hull and computes
  the eccentricity as a metric of ellongation
}
\note{
  Saving the ellipses is optional. If ellipses are not
  saved, the eccentricity values will still be computed and
  saved as a hull metric. The only real reason to save
  ellipses is if you wish to plot them.

  Note creating ellipses is computationally intensive and
  can take a long time.
