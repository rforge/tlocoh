\title{Class for a series of locations}
\description{
  Class for locations with associated dates, nearest
  neighbor info, parameters for a random walk null model,
  and assorted meta-data
}
\details{
  An object of class LoCoH.lxy is a list containing a
  series of point locations and ancillary variables that go
  with those locations (e.g., time stamps, point IDs,
  animal IDs). These items are bundled together and 'ready
  to go' as inputs into T-LoCoH functions.

  The reasons for bundling all of the objects related to a
  set of point locations in a single list object includes:

  \itemize{

  \item the cleaning and error checking only has to be done
  once when the lxy object is created with the xyt.lxy
  function

  \item having all of the ancillary variables together
  simplifies the task of passing parameters to other
  functions as well as saving/retrieving your work to disk

  \item it allows re-use of the nearest neighbor
  lookup-table (which can take a long time to compute)

  }

  In code examples, objects of class LoCoH.lxy are often
  named 'lxy'.

\section{Data Structure}{
  The named elements in the list include:

  \describe{ \item{xys}{a two-column data frame containing
  the x and y coordinates of each point}

  \item{col}{a vector (or factor) of color values. May also
  be NULL}

  \item{ptid}{an integer vector of unique id values for
  each point}

  \item{id}{a character vector or factor containing the ids
  of the individuals (e.g., name of the animal, GPS device)
  associated with each points }

  \item{dt}{a vector of date-stamps (class POSIXct) for
  each point. May also be NULL.}

  \item{anv}{a data frame of ancillary variables for each
  location, each column is a variable, and the number of
  rows equals the number of points}

  \item{dt.int}{a four-column data frame containing a
  frequency table of the time interval between points.
  Columns include: id, interval, count, and rtn (where rtn
  is the round-to-nearest value (in seconds) that was used
  in binning the delta.t values).}

  \item{rw.params}{a three-column data frame containing the
  parameters used to compute the predicted 'diffusion
  distance' for any pair of points as a function of the
  difference in time. Columns of the data frame includ: id,
  time.step.median and d.bar (median step-length)}

  \item{aux}{either NULL or a list object of auxillary data
  associated with the points. This can include spatial
  elements to be overlaid when lxy is plotted, or other
  meta-data associated with the lxy. There is one list
  element per ID, and each of those elements is another
  list containing two named elements: \code{type}, and
  \code{data}: \tabular{rll}{ \tab \strong{type} \tab
  \strong{data}\cr \tab \code{text} \tab a data frame with
  columns x, y, label, pos\cr \tab \code{lines} \tab a list
  containing named elements 'xy' and 'lty' and 'col'\cr
  \tab \code{data.frame} \tab a data frame\cr \tab
  \code{range.expand} \tab a two-element numeric vector
  that will be added to both xlim and ylim in
  \link{plot.LoCoH.lxy}. To reduce the range on the x-axis,
  for example to make space for labels, the first element
  should be negative.\cr } }

  \item{comment}{a named list of descriptive text. One list
  element per id; the item name is the id. The default is a
  constructed string consisting of the ID(s) and number of
  points per ID. May also be NULL.}

  \item{nn}{Nearest neighbor lookup table. Can also be
  NULL. Before hulls can be constructed, nearest neighbors
  have to be identified using \code{\link{lxy.nn.add}}.
  Note:

  \itemize{ \item A different set of nearest neighbors will
  exist for each value of s, because s determines how
  point-to-point distance is computed.  \item Once nearest
  neighbors have been identified, they can be used to
  construct hulls for a variety of parameters and nearest
  neighbor selection method (e.g., k, r, or a method).
  \item For a set of nearest neighbors, the maximum
  possible value for k, r, and a are saved as list
  elements. If you want to construct hulls for a larger
  value of k, r, or a, you must first identify additional
  nearest neighbors using \code{\link{lxy.nn.add}}.  }

  The nearest neighbor lookup table is a list of lists. The
  name of each list element is a pipe-delimited character
  string that uniquely identifies the parameters for that
  list. Each element of this list is another list with the
  following elements:

  \itemize{ \item id \item s \item kmax \item rmax \item
  amax \item ptid (a vector of ptid values that have
  nearest neighbors identified for the current ID) \item
  auto.a.df - a data frame of the auto-a values that have
  been calculated. See \code{\link{auto.a}}. Columns
  include: \enumerate{ \item a.meth \item a.pp \item a.nn
  \item a.h \item a.tct \item auto.a } \item time.taken =
  time taken to find the nearest neighbors (in seconds)
  \item nn.df = a data frame with the following five
  columns: \enumerate{ \item pp.idx = index of the parent
  point from lxy$xys \item nn.rank = nearest neighbor rank
  (integer), starting from 0 for the parent point. Points
  with no eligible parent points will be have only the
  parent point itself as the 0th neighbor \item nn.idx =
  index of the nearest neighbor point from lxy$xys.
  Integer. For the 0th neighbor this will be the parent
  point index \item tsd = time-scaled-distance \item
  tsd.cumsum = the cumulative tsd } }
