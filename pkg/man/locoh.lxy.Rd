\title{Class for location data}
\description{
  Data class for locations with associated dates, nearest
  neighbor info, parameters for a random walk null model,
  and assorted meta-data
}
\details{
  An object of class locoh.lxy is a list containing a
  series of point locations and ancillary variables that go
  with those locations (e.g., time stamps, point IDs,
  animal IDs). These items are bundled together and 'ready
  to go' as inputs into T-LoCoH functions. The benefits of
  bundling all of the objects related to a set of point
  locations in a single list object includes:

  \itemize{ \item cleaning and error checking only has to
  be done once when the lxy object is created (e.g., with
  \code{\link{xyt.lxy}}) \item having all of the ancillary
  variables together simplifies the task of passing
  parameters to other functions as well as
  saving/retrieving your work to disk \item the nearest
  neighbor lookup-table (which can take a long time to
  compute) can be reused \item locations for multiple
  individuals can be saved in one object }

  In code examples, objects of class locoh.lxy are often
  named 'lxy'.

\section{Data Structure}{
  The named elements in the list include:

  \describe{ \item{pts}{a \link{SpatialPointsDataFrame} of
  the locations. Columns in the associated data frame vary
  but typically include:}

  \itemize{ \item \emph{ptid} - an integer vector of unique
  id values for each point \item \emph{id} - a character
  vector or factor containing the ids of the individuals
  (e.g., name of the animal, GPS device) associated with
  each point \item \emph{dt} - a vector of date-stamps
  (class POSIXct) for each point \item \emph{col} - a
  vector (or factor) of color values \item various other
  ancillary variables associated with each location }

  \item{anv}{A data frame of meta data of the ancillary
  variables associated with each point (or NULL if none).
  Column names are \emph{anv} (corresponding to the column
  name in \code{pts} and \emph{desc} (description)}

  \item{dt.int}{a four-column data frame containing a
  frequency table of the time interval between points.
  Columns include: id, interval, count, and rtn (where rtn
  is the round-to-nearest value (in seconds) that was used
  in binning the delta.t values).}

  \item{rw.params}{a four-column data frame containing the
  parameters used to compute the predicted 'diffusion
  distance' for any pair of points as a function of the
  difference in time. Columns of the data frame includ:
  \emph{id}, \emph{time.step.median}, \emph{d.bar} (median
  step-length), and \emph{vmax} (maximum observed
  velocity)}

  \item{comment}{a named list of descriptive text. One list
  element per id; the item name is the id. The default is a
  constructed string consisting of the ID(s) and number of
  points per ID. May also be NULL.}

  \item{nn}{Nearest neighbor lookup table. Can also be
  NULL. Before hulls can be constructed, nearest neighbors
  have to be identified using \code{\link{lxy.nn.add}}.
  Note:

  \itemize{ \item A different set of nearest neighbors will
  exist for each value of s, because s determines how
  point-to-point distance is computed.  \item Once nearest
  neighbors have been identified, they can be used to
  construct hulls for a variety of parameters and nearest
  neighbor selection method (e.g., k, r, or a method).
  \item For a set of nearest neighbors, the maximum
  possible value for k, r, and a are saved as list
  elements. If you want to construct hulls for a larger
  value of k, r, or a, you must first identify additional
  nearest neighbors using \code{\link{lxy.nn.add}}.  }

  The nearest neighbor lookup table is a list of lists. The
  name of each list element is a pipe-delimited character
  string that uniquely identifies the parameters for that
  list. Each element of this list is another list with the
  following elements:

  \itemize{ \item id \item s \item kmax \item rmax \item
  amax \item ptid (a vector of ptid values that have
  nearest neighbors identified for the current ID) \item
  auto.a.df - a data frame of the auto-a values that have
  been calculated. See \code{\link{auto.a}}. Columns
  include: \enumerate{ \item a.meth \item a.pp \item a.nn
  \item a.h \item a.tct \item auto.a } \item time.taken =
  time taken to find the nearest neighbors (in seconds)
  \item nn.df = a data frame with the following five
  columns: \enumerate{ \item pp.idx = index of the parent
  point from lxy$xys \item nn.rank = nearest neighbor rank
  (integer), starting from 0 for the parent point. Points
  with no eligible parent points will be have only the
  parent point itself as the 0th neighbor \item nn.idx =
  index of the nearest neighbor point from lxy$xys.
  Integer. For the 0th neighbor this will be the parent
  point index \item tsd = time-scaled-distance \item
  tsd.cumsum = the cumulative tsd } }

  }

  \item{ptsh}{List of the proportion of time-selected hulls
  for different values of s (created with lxy.ptsh.add),
  based on a random sample of hulls. One list element for
  each id, and in each of those there will be an (unnamed)
  list element for each time lxy.ptsh was run.  Each of
  those will be a list containing elements: \emph{id,
  samp.idx, n, k, target.ptsh, target.s, s.ptsh,
  time.taken}.  See \code{\link{lxy.ptsh.add}}.}
