\usage{
  lxy.merge(..., pts.flds = "all", save.ptid = FALSE,
    new.id = NULL, save.old.id = NULL,
    dt.int.round.to = 0.1, tau.diff.max = 0.02)
}
\arguments{
  \item{...}{\link{LoCoH-xy} objects}

  \item{pts.flds}{A character vector of column names to
  include in the merged object, can also be \code{"all"} or
  \code{NULL}}

  \item{save.ptid}{If duplicate ptid values are encounted
  in the merged object, whether to save the original ptid
  values as an ancillary variable, T/F}

  \item{new.id}{A new id value for the merged object}

  \item{save.old.id}{A boolean or the name of a ancillary
  variable where the old id values will be saved}

  \item{dt.int.round.to}{The proportion of the median
  sampling frequency that time intervals will be rounded to
  when computing the frequency table of sampling intervals
  (no change is made to the time stamps)}

  \item{tau.diff.max}{The maximum deviation from tau (the
  median delta.t of the entire dataset), expressed as a
  proportion of tau, that time difference between two
  points must fall for the distance between those two
  points to be included in the calculation of the median
  step length}

\description{
  Merges LoCoH-xy objects together
}
\details{
  The coordinate system of the LoCoH-xy objects being
  merged must be the same. Also each lxy object must have
  the same data columns present, e.g., dt, col, ancillary
  variables, etc. To merge a subset of the attribute
  fields, use the \code{pts.flds} parameter.

  Because LoCoH-xy object must have unique ptid values for
  each location, if the merged object contains duplicate
  ptid values new one will be created. If
  \code{save.ptid=TRUE}, the 'old' ptid values will be
  saved as \code{ptid.orig}.

  The merged object will no have nearest neighbors table
  and the random walk parameters will be recomputed.
