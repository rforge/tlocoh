\description{
Computes proportion of enclosed points of a second set of points
}
\note{
The proportion of enclosed points is a hull metric that measures relative association among N individuals when you
have movement data for multiple individuals simultaneous over the same tim period. The general idea is to create hulls
for all of the locations combined (ignoring which location was for each individual), then for each hull look at the
proportion of enclosed points for each individual. If the individuals ignored each other, one would expect the
proportion of enclosed points for any given hull to be approximately equal to the proportions of each individual in the
entire dataset. Deviations from this random mixing null model reflect places where the individuals did not mix evenly
(e.g., one dominated).

Do compute pep, all points must have the same id (beause you create hulls with the combined dataset) with the original
id values saved as an ancillary variable (see \code{\link{lxy.id.new}}). Create hulls as you normally would using the 'a' or 'k' method,
although it would be recommneded to omit time (let s=0) because the time difference between locations means different things for different pairs of points
depending on whether they are from the same or different individuals. Pass the name of the ancillary variable that contains the original ids as
\code{pep.var} and the original id value(s) as \code{pep.val} (if \code{pep.val} is omitted the pep metric will be computed for all id values
found in \code{pep.var}. \emph{npep} (normalized proportion of enclosed points) normalizes pep by the proportion of that
individual in the entire dataset, such that \emph{npep=1} means the individual was in the hull in the same proportion
as it was in the entire dataset.
